### ➢ Worked with the Northwind Database, a widely used sample database containing 12 relational tables (Customers, Orders, Employees, Products, Shippers, etc.), designed to simulate a real-world trading company’s operations.
### ➢ Analyze, query, and manage relational data to derive business insights such as sales performance, customer trends, employee contributions, and supplier efficiency.
### ➢ Designed and optimized SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data across multiple related tables. Implemented joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and grouping for detailed analysis. Explored schema relationships (e.g., Customers ↔ Orders ↔ Order_Details ↔ Products) to answer business-oriented questions. Created views and reports for sales, shipping, and product-category analysis.
### ➢ Gained hands-on experience in database design, query optimization, and business reporting. Improved query writing efficiency by 40% and delivered accurate insights on sales and customer behavior that could support decision-making in a real business scenario.
